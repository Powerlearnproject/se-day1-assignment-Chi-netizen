#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering means applying engineering principles  and techniques to design, develop, maintain and troubleshoot software programs. It is the means through which applications are developed and implemented.It plays a pivotal role in modern technology by allowing the development of software applications that impact/power all aspects of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The the 1950's to 1960's there was introduction of high level programming languages which revolutionised the earlier used software assembly language, which was complex and difficult to read. Between the 1970's to 1980's there was the introcution of Structured programming concepts like modularity, top-down design, and control flow structures which helped organize and improve the readability of software code.From the 1990's to 2000s Agile Development Methodologies were introcuced and this led to promotion of continuous collaboration, feedback, and adaptation to changing requirements.The results was faster software delivery, increased flexibility, and improved customer satisfaction

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a) Requirements Gathering and Analysis- Determine the needs and objectives of stakeholders, Gather and analyze functional and non-functional requirements.
b) Design- Create architectural and detailed design documents, Define the system's functionality, structure, and interfaces.
c) Implementation- Convert the design into executable code. Develop and test individual components.
d) Testing- Verify and validate the software to ensure it meets requirements.Perform unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.
e) Deployment- Release the software into production, Train users and provide support.
f) Maintenance- Address defects, enhancements, and other changes to the software.Respond to user feedback and changing requirements.
g) Retirement-  Phase out the software when it is no longer needed or supported.Securely archive or dispose of software and data.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology is a linear, sequential model for software development that follows a predetermined set of phases. Each phase is typically completed before the next phase begins.
This methodology involves the following phases:
a) Requirements Gathering and Analysis: Defining the project's functional and non-functional requirements.
b) Design: Creating detailed blueprints for the system, like architecture, database schema, and UI designs.
c) Implementation: Developing the software based on the design specifications.
d) Testing: Thoroughly testing the software to ensure its functionality and quality.
e) Deployment: Installation and configuration of the software in the production environment.
f) Maintenance: Provide ongoing support and updates to the deployed software.
Waterfall Methodology is best for the following Projects Scenarios:-
a) Projects with well-defined requirements that are unlikely to change significantly.
b) Projects with a stable scope and minimal risk of ambiguity.
c) Projects where upfront planning is crucial for regulatory compliance or other external constraints.
d) Projects with a long development timeline where a structured approach is preferred.

Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and continuous improvement. It focuses on delivering working software frequently in small, manageable increments, allowing stakeholders to provide feedback and influence the development process.
This methodology is defined by the following key principles
a) Iterative: Development is broken down into small, iterative cycles (sprints).
b) Incremental: Software is delivered in small, functional chunks at the end of each sprint.
c) Adaptive: Changes in requirements and priorities are embraced and accommodated throughout the process.
d) Collaborative: Teams work closely together, including developers, product owners, and stakeholders.
e) Customer-centric: Development revolves around meeting the needs and expectations of the end-users.
f) Continuous Improvement: Teams reflect on their progress and make adjustments to process, tools, and practices.

This Methodology is best for the following Projects Scenarios:-
a) Projects with evolving or uncertain requirements.
b) Projects with a high degree of uncertainty or risk.
c) Projects where user involvement and feedback are crucial for success.
d) Projects with tight deadlines and a need for frequent updates.
e) Projects where flexibility and adaptability are more important than upfront planning.

Importance: Provides a final validation before the system is deployed and ensures that the system aligns with business objectives and user expectations.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is creating instructions that are precise to enable the AI system to interpret and perform specific tasks

importance in interacting with AI models:
Clarity and Specificity: Well-constructed prompts ensure that the AI understands the exact task or question you're asking. This leads to more accurate and relevant responses.
Contextual Understanding: By providing context in your prompts, you help the AI better understand the nuances of your query, leading to more informative and tailored answers.
Guiding the AI: Prompt engineering allows you to guide the AI's thought process and steer it towards specific outcomes. This can be particularly useful when seeking creative or problem-solving responses.
Avoiding Bias: By carefully crafting prompts, you can minimize the risk of the AI perpetuating biases or stereotypes present in the training data.
Improving Model Performance: Effective prompt engineering can help AI models learn faster and perform better on various tasks.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt:
Write a story about war.

Improved Prompt:
Write a 500-word short story about king Hussein who ruled Zowea Kingdom, he sent his son named Ziwa to join his army in conquering a rival Kingdom named Zubera, but Ziwa gets captured by enemy forces who use him as collateral to force King Hussein into a treaty to never invade their kingdom again.
The improved prompt is more effective because it is clear and concise, providing a solid foundation for a short story. It outlines the main plot points and introduces the key characters: King Hussein, his son Ziwa, and the rival Kingdom of Zubera.
